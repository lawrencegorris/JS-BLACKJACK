# BLACKJACK in JS
An attempt to create a version of the popular (and my personal favourite) gambling/card game Blackjack, aka 21.

## The rules
If you don't know the rules, you can take a look here:
https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/

## The Javascript:
The game consists of three different files:
- a file for creating the card deck
- a file with all the functions and logic
- a file to start the game

The largest file is the function file. Here you will find all the automation for dealing the cards to the hand and the logic for the dealer.

## The styling
Not much styling for this project, might update at a later date.
